working on the code slides and the book 
“Conditional ignorability (CI) implies that you observe all of the variables that influence both the treatment and the response. 
Whenever you hear a causal statement that includes “after controlling for other factors,” there is an implicit assumption of conditional ignorability. ”
“almost all treatment effect estimation problems are high-dimensional problems when viewed from a high level, and we already know that standard OLS 
regression techniques are an imperfect tool for high-dimensional problems. You will need to adapt the ML tools, like lasso and CV, for causal 
inference under the conditional ignorability model.”
the abortion example really did help me understand it 
HTE model allows treatment effect to vary across individuals or groups
the impact of a treatment (d) on an outcome (y) depends on the observable charactaristics or unobsorvable charactaristics (x)
