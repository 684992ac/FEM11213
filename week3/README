Freshened up on regression
r paractice with running the code and debugging the code mostly with chat gpt
Key Concepts to remember 
Deviance shows how good of a fit is the model 
null deviance vs fitted model 
R'2 and generalized R^2 
satured models b1=b1^
null model b0=mean
log-log model good to meassure elasticities
