Looking in to uncertainity 
going through the slides and the book 
implementing  the code while going throught the material
1)created a bootstrap loop and run a regression on the coefficients 
2) bootstrapping more usefull if the general assumptions for frequientist distribution don't hold.
3) Frequentist approach still better with small sample size if the sample is close to the mean 
Run BH algorithm created the graph
